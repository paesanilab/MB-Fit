# setting up a postgreSQL server
choose the appropriate installation gude from:
https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides
or install via anaconda with
```
conda install postgresql
```

The installation process will usually automatically initialize a database in
```/usr/local/pgsql/data``` but if it does not, you should initialize a database
manually with
```
initdb <path to where data will be stored>
```

once you have installed postgres, you may launch the server using:
```
postgres -D <path to where data is stored>
```
Note: unless you chose a different directory, the <path to where data is stored> is
generally ```/usr/local/pgsql/data```.

If you see an error that looks like this:
"could not bind IPv6 adress "::1": Address already in use"
you might need to change the port number for the database to operate on.
If you need to change the port number for this or any other reason, edit
<path to where data is stored>/postgresql.conf and change the line
```
#port = 5432
```
to
```
port = <desired port>
```
If you leave this line commented out, it will use the default port 5432.
If you do not use the default port, you will have to add ```-p <desired port>```
to most console commands below.

For further troubleshooting and more information, check:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/server-start.html

Next, create a database on the server with the following command:
```
createdb <name of database>
```
For troubleshooting and more information, check:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/tutorial-createdb.html

Then, connect to the database (still from the host machine) using
```
psql <name of database>
```
For troubleshooting and more information, check:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/tutorial-accessdb.html

Next, we will add users with passwords so that the database can be accessed
securely and remotely.
From inside the database console opened by ```psql <name of database>``` run
```
CREATE USER <username> WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<new password>';
```
For more details, see:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/sql-createuser.html

How you handle users is up to you, you may create one user for each member of
your team, or you may make a single username and password to share.

Now, we must change the configuration settings to ask for a password upon connection:
inside <path to where data is stored> edit 'pg_hba.conf'. Change all entries in
the 'METHOD' column from 'trust' to 'md5'.

Now, restart the database, by stopping the process launched by 
```
postgres -D <path to where data is stored>
```
and then running that command again.

Now, you should be able to log in LOCALLY using your username and password. Try it:
```
psql <database name> -U <username>
```
You will be prompted for your password.

Now, we need to enable remote connections.
To do so, edit 'postgresql.conf' inside <path to where data is stored>. Change the line:
```
#listen_addresses = 'localhost'
```
to:
```
listen_addresses = '*'
```

Then, open 'pg_hba.conf' again and add the lines:
```
host    all             all              0.0.0.0/0                       md5
host    all             all              ::/0                            md5
```
to the end of the file.

Now, we need to open the port that postgres runs on to accept incoming connections.
In order to do this, you will need sudo access on your machine.
Run:
```
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=<port number>/tcp
```
If you did not change the port number, it is the default: 5432
Now, to automatically open the port when your machine reboots, optionally run:
```
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=<port number>/tcp --permanent
```
Alternatively, you can manually run the first command when your system reboots or add it to a startup script.

Restart the server again.

Now, you should be able to log into the database remotely from a client machine.
To do so run the following on the client:
```
psql -h <host name or IP> -p <host port> -d <database name> -U <username>
```
You will be prompted for your password.

Note that you will need to have the postgresql client installed, which you can get from here:
https://www.postgresql.org/download/
or install via anaconda with
```
conda install postgresql
```
Though the anaconda method will install both the client and the server.

Then, run database_setup.py in order to initialize the tables and routines needed to run the MB-Fit server. database_setup.py is located in the home MB-Fit directory.
database_setup.py takes a database config file as its argument.
The format of the database config file should be as follows:
```
[database]
host = <host name or IP>
port = <host port of connection>
database = <name of the database>
username = <your username>
password = <your password>
```

Before putting your password in any file, make sure to use
```
chmod 700 <name of file>
```
to make sure only you can access the file.

Also, of course, use a unique password.

If you want to change your password, use:
```
ALTER USER <username> WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<new password>';
```
from inside the database console.
